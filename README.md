This repository is mainly dedicated only for the ITCRC, as I have several other projects and files in other repositories.
I am currently learning at a coding platform, and I have a separate repository for that as well. You can check that out as well:
https://github.com/Farhan-Akter-Arnab/Actual-Code-items.git
I also have yet another repository, which is mainly for a website completely developed by myself with a series of steps and several commits.
However, one has to be cautious because there are something in that repository that might surprise or suffocate someone [Not offensive but fishy].
By the way, you can also check that repository if you want:
https://github.com/Farhan-Akter-Arnab/Mathematical-Unity-Code-Items.git
Anyways, best wishes in seeing this repository!
